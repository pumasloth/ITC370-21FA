    <h2>Hello and Welcome - I'm Ethan Penrose!</h2>
    <p>I love to play fetch with my dog. I work as a computer programmer during the day and during the night or not at
        work, I enjoy partaking in the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Watching movies</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <li>Hiking and the outdoors</li>
        <li>Music and the guitar</li>
        <li>Cooking</li>
        <li>Golf</li>
        <li>Traveling and sight seeing</li>
        <li>Games</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I look forward to this class and diving in some HTML.</p>
